Olson at the Scripps Research Institute, and have tinkered with it ever since. I have used it to create materials for my [books](https://ccsb.scripps.edu/goodsell/publication/) and for [PDB-101](http://pdb101.rcsb.org/), the outreach portal of the RCSB Protein Data Bank, most notably, for the [“Molecule of the Month.”](http://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/motm-about)\n\n**Official website:** https://ccsb.scripps.edu/illustrate/\n\n**Publication:** Goodsell, D.
