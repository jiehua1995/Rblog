> **Illustrate** is a small Fortran program for creating non-photorealistic illustrations of molecules, with cartoony colors and outlines, and soft ambient shadows. I originally developed it during postdoctoral training in the laboratory of Arthur J. Olson at the Scripps Research Institute, and have tinkered with it ever since. I have used it to create materials for my [books](https://ccsb.scripps.edu/goodsell/publication/) and for [PDB-101](http://pdb101.rcsb.org/), the outreach portal of the RCSB Protein Data Bank, most notably, for the [“Molecule of the Month.”](http://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/motm-about)
